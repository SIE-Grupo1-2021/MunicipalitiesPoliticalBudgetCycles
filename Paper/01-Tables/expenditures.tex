\textit{Note: Table \ref{table:expenditures} presents three categories of expenditure and its components analyzed in this paper: Remuneration, Services and Durable Goods. Each one and their components are categorized by a "0", "1" and "5" at the beggining of their classification code, respectively. The most aggregate budget item is identified with a single digit code, followed by the second level of disaggregation with a three digit code, and finally with a 5 digit code we have the most simple and specific item. This means that, for example, all items beginning with "0", belong to "Remuneration". Further on, all items beginning with "0.01", belong to "Basic Remuneration" and subsequently for the rest. The description of each item is extracted from the official Public Budget Code Guide from the Minister of Finance \parencite{Finance2018}. The information is extracted from the databases of the Comptroller General of the Republic (CGR).}
