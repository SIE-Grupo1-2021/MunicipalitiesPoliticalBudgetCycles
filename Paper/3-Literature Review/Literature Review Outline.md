Literature Review Outline

1. PBC theoritical framework establishment: 

1.1. Nordhaus (1975):

1.1.1.   Examines the behavior democratic political systems have when facing                choices between present and future welfare, particularly the trade-off                 between inflation and unemployment. 

1.1.2.   Concludes that incumbents tend to go from austerity early on their term              to “plotarch” in election periods.

 

1.2. Rogoff, Sibbert (1988): 

1.2.1.   Illustrates the importance of temporary information asymmetries in            electoral cycles and how it can be taken advantage of by politicians por              political benefits, especially for macroeconomic policy variables. He        especially refers to possible short term Keynesian Philips curve to raise               output and employment. 

1.2.2.   Voters observe taxes and spending, but govt investment is observed with             one period lag only.

1.2.3.   Agrees with Nordhaus that PBC have the potential to deteriorate welfare.

 

2. PBC studied at a national level: 

2.1. Gonzalez (2002): Uses data from Mexico: 

2.1.1.   Infrastructure spending seems to be the most manipulated for political               purposes prior to federal elections.

2.1.2.   Evidence suggest that this starts at least six quarters before the election              and then diminishes the quarter when the election is settled.

2.1.3.   Evidence slightly suggests that current transfers are also increased                   particularly during the election quarter itself.

2.1.4.   The magnitude of PBC is exacerbated in periods with more democratic                stability. Meaning that the govt relies too much on pre-election spending             to retain power as the democratization process has strengthen.

 

2.2. Lankester (2017): Similar to (2002), 

2.2.1.   Examines macroeconomic fiscal variables fo 13 Latin American countries: 

2.2.2.   She finds timid evidence favoring the existence of PBC in Latin American              countries.

2.2.3.   At the national level, she argues that the effectiveness fiscal manipulation             is determined by time and the specific sets of economic conditions.

 

3. Start of PBC studied at the level of local governments:

3.1. Most importante references in PBC studies at local govt level: 

3.1.1.   Veiga and Veiga (2007): Using data from Portuguese municipalities:

3.1.1.1.     Significant increase in expenditure and reduction in taxes, mainly in investment expedenture “highly visible to the electorate” (Buildings + construction).

3.1.1.2.     Less is spent on categories “not visible” to electorate such as transportation, machinery and equipment. 

3.1.1.3.     PBC magnitud does not depend on the municipal assembly support towards the mayor.

3.1.1.4.     Concludes: The instability on investment spending is an inneficient allocation of resources. More regulation towards of management and debt accumlation could be benificial.

3.1.2.   Drazen and Eslava (2010): Using data from Colombian local governments:

3.1.2.1.     PBC can be better seen in budget composition rather than the level of govt expenditure. No evidence in Colombia of deficits and total expenditure like Veiga and Veiga (2007) found in Portugal.

3.1.2.2.     Electoral manipulation happens shifting spending towards goods that voters as a whole prefer.

3.1.2.3.     PBC in fact increases the chances of parties being reelected (since immediate reelection is not permited in Colombia).

3.1.2.4.     The main categories used for manipulation are: infraestrure and construction of water and power plants.

3.1.2.5.     Voters may penalize incumbents’ parties for higher spending if it implicates large fiscal deficits.

 

4. Additional contributions to PBC at local governments: 

4.1. Sakurai, Menezes-Filho (2011): Data from Brazil: 

4.1.1.   Evidence suggests that fiscal surplus of local governments decreases in elections years, due to increase in spending and decrease in taxation.

4.1.2.   Contrary to the findings of Veiga and Veiga (2007) and Drazen A, Eslava M. (2010), they find that investments decline in election years. Which means that countries with similar economic developments, may show different results when measuring opportunistic cycles.

4.1.2.1.     Similar findings: Setiawan and Rizkiah (2017) there is a significant decrease on investments the year prior to elections but budget deficit increases in election years. (Data from Indonesia)

4.1.3.   Each fiscal variable behaves differently around elections years and according to the political alignment with higher levels of government.

4.1.3.1.     Supported by Corvalan, Cox and Osorio (2018): Evidence for presence of iPBC: Central govt transfers to municipalities increase during municipal elections. This increase if significantly larger when the incumbent are politically aligned with the national government. Among aligned mayors, the transfer increase is even larger when the margin is tight. (Data from Chile)

4.1.3.2.     Chortareas, Logothetis, Papandreou (2016) explore this idea and found that whether the mayor is running for reelection, or if they ae politically aligned with the central government, there is no effect in PBC. (Data from Greece)

4.1.4.   They also conclude that young democracies or developing countries are more susceptible to opportunistic fiscal manipulation.

4.1.4.1.     Similar to the idea of Veiga and Veiga (2007) of bigger distortions in more democratic periods as a way to retain power. 

 

4.2. Additional contributions (observation of other variables): 

4.2.1.   Tenure (Terms in service):

4.2.1.1.     Chortareas, Logothetis, Papandreou (2016): Prolonged incumbencies do not affect PBC.

4.2.1.2.     Setiawan and Rizkiah (2017): Evidence for direct relationship between years as mayor (tenure) and magnitude of expenditure increases.

4.2.2.   Age of incumbent: 

4.2.2.1.     Alesina, Cassidy and Troiano (2019): Younger politicians engage more on PBC than older ones. The paper gives the following reasoning: Younger politicians are more concerned with their long term prospects and careers. Younger politicians are more likely to be re-elected. Although statistically insignificant, there is evidence of PBC and re-election. (Data from Italy)

4.2.3.   Employment: 

4.2.3.1.     Labonne (2016): Following the framework of Phillips curve of Nordaus (1975), sees that employment increased in the two pre-electoral quarters and dropped sharply aftert he elections. Evidence strongly shows that the increase in employment are caused by the shift in the local govt spending composition. The cycles are more pronounced where the incumbent’s term is limited and trying to transfer the position to a relative, and less pronounced when there are no challengers. (Data from Phillipines)

4.2.4.   Fiscal rule aplication: 

4.2.4.1.     Bonfatti and Forni (2019): Municipalities subject to the fiscal rule (pop >5000) show significant less manifestation of PBC that local governments not subject to this limit. Municipalities increase real capital spending but the sub-national fiscal rule off sets its effect. (Data from Italy)

 

4.3. PBC and the effects of re-election chances: 

4.3.1. Veiga, Veiga and Aidt (2010): Theoretical to determine the two way relationship between the incumbent win margin and opportunistic fiscal distortion. Empirical evidence that PBC works: Incumbent chances of re-election increase when expenditure in election periods increase. Doing this works in favor of politicians. Inverse relationship between distortion and margin, meaning that the distortion is biggest when the margin is small. Opportunism increases when capital transfers from the central govt increase. (Data from Portugal)

4.3.2. Similar to the findings of Drazen and Eslava (2010), Cassette and Farvaque (2014) found that voters punish incumbents for the accumulation of debt, with an effect increasing with the debt level. Short-term effects (i.e., increases in debt right before the election) act in the other direction. This thus reveals that elections are debt brakes, even if blunt ones. (Data from France)
