Most tests of this theory look for evidence of pre-election distortions in fiscal policy. We propose a new test that explores the two-way interaction between the magnitude of the opportunistic distortion and the margin of victory. The test is implemented using a large panel of Portuguese municipalities. The results show that opportunism leads to a larger win-margin for the incumbent and that incumbents behave more opportunistically when their win-margin is small. These results are consistent with the theoretical model.},

The new real estate tax allowed discretion to local governments. This generates a random variation in the distance of municipalities from the following elections when they choose the level of the tax rate. We do find substantial evidence of political budget cycles, with municipalities choosing lower tax rates when close to elections. We observe this budget cycle for smaller municipalities where the tax was more likely to be the single most important issue for the local government. Cities close to elections with large deficits did not set lower rates and so did municipalities with a lower average value of properties. Finally, the political budget cycle is stronger in the South.},

It uses data on Italian municipalities during the 2000s and shows that: 1) municipalities are subject to political budget cycles in capital spending; 2) the Italian sub-national fiscal rule (Domestic Stability Pact, DSP) introduced in 1999 has been enforced by the central government; 3) municipalities subject to the fiscal rule show more limited political budget cycles than municipalities not subject to the rule. In order to identify the effect, we rely on the fact that the domestic fiscal rule does not apply to municipalities below 5000 inhabitants. We find that the political budget cycle increases real capital spending by about 10–20 percent on average in the years prior to municipal elections and that municipalities subject to the DSP show a pre-electoral increase in capital spending which is only a quarter of the one of municipalities not subject to the rule.},

We also consider whether opportunistic policies influence incumbents' reelection prospects finding that increased expenditures and election year opportunistic excesses are electorally rewarding. Our findings provide a characterization of opportunistic public finance management in Greek municipalities where electorally motivated budgetary decisions appear impervious to the various municipal reform attempts.},

However, when local governments depend on national resources, the central government may have incentives to manipulate intergovernmental transfers to favor politically aligned mayors, in order to use their help to mobilize voters in the next national election. This generates an indirect Political Budget Cycle (iPBC). This paper documents the presence of an iPBC in Chile. We show that, during municipal election years, the government increases the overall amount of transfers to municipalities (local governments), and that these additional resources are allocated to the politically aligned mayors. We also report that transfers to aligned mayors are higher when the local races are tighter, suggesting that the government prefers to deviate resources towards swing municipalities. Finally, we show that transfers are correlated with municipal spending during electoral years, and with both local and national political electoral outcomes.},

Classifying expenditures into those which are likely targeted to voters and those that are not, we provide evidence supporting our model in data on local public finances for all Colombian municipalities.

The aim is to implement generalized method of moment techniques such that useful and reasonably accurate inferences can be extracted from an observational panel data set on a single microeconometric structural presumably dynamic behavioral relationship. In the suggested specification search three comprehensive heavily interconnected goals are pursued: (i) to include all the relevant appropriately transformed possibly lagged regressors, as well as any interactions between these, if it is required to relax the otherwise very strict homogeneity restrictions on the dynamic impacts of the explanatories in standard linear panel data models; (ii) to correctly classify all regressors as either endogenous, predetermined or exogenous, as well as being either effect-stationary or effect-nonstationary, implying which internal variables could represent valid and relatively strong instruments; (iii) to enhance the accuracy of inference in finite samples by omitting redundant regressors and by profitably reducing the space spanned by the full set of available internal instruments. For the various tests which trigger the decisions to be made in the sequential selection process the relevant considerations are spelled out to interpret the magnitude of p-values. Also the complexities to estimate and interpret the ultimately established dynamic impacts are explained. Finally the developed strategy is applied to a classic data set and is shown to yield new insights.},

   abstract = {This study aims to examine the presence of politically induced and electorally motivated economic policy in local government budget. Further, the study examine the presence of pre-electoral manipulation through the behavior of budget balance, total expenditures, investment expenditures, and other administrative expenditures including donations, social assistance, and financial assistance expenditure during election year. Samples of the study consists of 451 district municipalities in Indonesia which held direct local elections over the period 2010-2014. The result of the study shows an opportunistic PBC pattern in the budget balance, total expenditures, donation expenditures, and financial assistance expenditures. The result suggest that there is an increase in local budget deficit in election years. Total expenditures also seem to increase during the election year, along with donation and financial assistance expenditures. This result supports the notion that elections have a positive effect on the government expenditures through the increase of municipal expenditures, especially expenditures that are highly visible to electorate.},

   abstract = {It is commonly argued that skilled immigration benefits the destination country through several channels. Yet, only a small group of countries reports to have policies in place aimed at increasing the intake of skilled immigrants. Why? In this paper we analyze the factors that affect a direct measure of individual attitudes towards skilled migration, focusing on two main channels: the labor market and the welfare state. We find that more educated natives are less likely to favor skilled immigration - consistent with the labor-market channel - while richer people are more likely to do so - in accordance with the welfare state channel under the tax adjustment model. Our findings thus suggest that the labor market competition threat perceived by skilled natives in the host countries might be driving the observed cautious policies.},

   abstract = {The present article tests predictions of rational political business cycle models using a large and previously unexplored data set of Portuguese municipalities This data allows for a clean test of these predictions due to the high level of detail on expenditure items, an exogenous fixed election schedule, and homogeneity of Portuguese local governments with respect to policy instruments and institutions Estimation results clearly reveal the opportunistic behaviour of local governments In pre-electoral periods, they increase total expenditures and change their composition favouring items that are highly visible to the electorate This behaviour is consistent with an effort to signal competence and increase chances of re-election},

   abstract = {Monte Carlo studies have shown that estimated asymptotic standard errors of the efficient two-step generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator can be severely downward biased in small samples. The weight matrix used in the calculation of the efficient two-step GMM estimator is based on initial consistent parameter estimates. In this paper it is shown that the extra variation due to the presence of these estimated parameters in the weight matrix accounts for much of the difference between the finite sample and the usual asymptotic variance of the two-step GMM estimator, when the moment conditions used are linear in the parameters. This difference can be estimated, resulting in a finite sample corrected estimate of the variance. In a Monte Carlo study of a panel data model it is shown that the corrected variance estimate approximates the finite sample variance well, leading to more accurate inference. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.
